LightTable plugin for displaying relative line numbers similiar to VIM.

Add

[:editor :lt.objs.editor/line-numbers]

to your "Settings: User behaviors" file to activate.

By default will display current line (rather than 0) and will display line numbers in insert mode. Set :lt.plugins.relativelinenumbers/relative-linenumber-settings behaviour to modify these defaults.
